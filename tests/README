Auth_PrefManager2 Test Suite Readme
$Id$
-------------------------------------------
Auth_PrefManager2 uses the Simple Test unit testing framework to ensure
that the package does what it says it will, and to make sure that no
bugs are introduced with new code.

To run the test suite you need to install Simple Test, to do this follow
the instructions below.

1. Download Simple Test from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=76550&package_id=77475,
   we use 1.0beta6, but an effort will be made to ensure the test suite works in future versions.
   
2. Extract the tarball to somewhere within your include_path (this directory should work).

Once Simple Test is installed just run php runtests.php to run the test suite.
